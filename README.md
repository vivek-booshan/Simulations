# diffeq_examples
Just a quick handful of python programs that use differential equations. See respective gifs for output
- attractors : see folder for more
- fem_beam.py : basic finite element model of beam
- heat_eqn_soln_basic.py : animated gif of the thermal behavior of a box using the heat equations
- laplace_ode_solver.ipynb : a general ODE solver using laplace transformations with step by steps shown
- machine-learning-ch3.ipynb : rough notes & practice from a machine learning course I took in highschool
- simple_pendulum.py : a comparison of linear and non linear solutions for a simple pendulum based on the initial angle provided
- rd.py : a 2d reaction diffusion simulation inspired by Sebastian Lague's youtube video on [slime mold simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&ab_channel=SebastianLague)
